## 👋 About Me  
I’m **Prayas Bharadwaj** — part engineer, part artist, all-in innovator. I build powerful systems that blend hardcore performance with beautiful visuals. Whether I’m deep in C++ internals or designing cinematic 3D scenes, I bring both grit and imagination to every line of code.

I specialize in **multithreaded rendering**, **graphics engines**, and **creative tooling** — the kind of work that turns big ideas into breathtaking execution.
