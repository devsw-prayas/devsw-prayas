## 👋 **About Me**
I’m **Prayas Bharadwaj**, founder and research lead of **StormWeaver Studios** — an independent R&D studio focused on advancing high-performance computing, graphics, and neural systems.

My work centers on building foundational technologies: large-scale multithreading runtimes, wavelength-domain light transport, deterministic deep learning engines, and the infrastructures that tie them together. I approach problems from a research perspective, and then engineer them into real, production-grade systems.

StormWeaver Studios is structured as a three-division research unit, each exploring a core domain of modern computation: **HPC**, **Graphics**, and **Deep Learning**.

# 🔬 **Research Divisions — StormWeaver Studios**

## **1. High-Performance Computing (HPC) Division**
The HPC division develops the **ultra-high-performance compute infrastructure** that forms the backbone of every system at StormWeaver Studios.

### **Focus areas:**
- Large-scale multithreading, scheduling, and task graphs  
- Advanced memory safety: shadow memory, lifetime tracking, deterministic heaps  
- High-throughput data structures, cache-aware and NUMA-aware layouts  
- HPC math: SIMD kernels, probabilistic numerics, stable computation  
- Lock-free concurrency and contention-aware systems  
- Deterministic execution and zero-overhead instrumentation  

### **Projects in this division:**
- **StormSTL** — data structures, allocators, memory primitives  
- **Corium** — parallel runtime & scheduler  
- **Stratum** — deterministic tracing & instrumentation  
- **Kerbecs** — shadow-memory sanitizer  
- **Leibniz** — SIMD-optimized math library  
- **Iota** — deep learning runtime (HPC + DL)  
- **Spectra Infrastructure Layer** — core HPC underpinning for the renderer  

## **2. Graphics & Rendering Research Division**
The Graphics division investigates the foundations and evolution of **light transport**, spanning RGB, spectral, and neural-augmented rendering models.

### **Focus areas:**
- Path Tracing — uni/bidirectional, mutation-based  
- RGB Rendering and hybrid real-time pipelines  
- Spectral Rendering and wavelength-domain simulation  
- Light Transport Theory — sampling, integrators, variance reduction  
- Neural Rendering — reconstruction and prediction models integrated into pipelines  

### **Projects in this division:**
- **Spectra** — research-first rendering engine  
- **Spectral & Neural Transport Modules** — neural and λ-domain extensions for Spectra  

## **3. Deep Learning Systems Division**
The Deep Learning division builds **HPC-oriented neural computation systems**, enabling deterministic, throughput-optimized AI pipelines for rendering and vision research.

### **Focus areas:**
- HPC Deep Learning with C++/CUDA  
- Throughput-optimized inference kernels  
- SIMD-accelerated neural math  
- Deterministic kernel execution and reproducibility  
- Custom operators for sampling, denoising, reconstruction  
- Vision Transformers and encoder models supporting rendering experiments  

### **Projects in this division:**
- **Iota** — in-house deep learning inference engine (DL + HPC)  
- **Neural Transport Models** — models consumed by Spectra  

# 🧠 **Core Competencies**

# 🎯 **Collaboration**
I collaborate on projects that intersect **HPC**, **Graphics**, and **Deep Learning** — especially those involving advanced rendering, systems research, or neural computation.

If you’re working on something ambitious, experimental, or technically challenging, I’m open to discussing it.

# 🧾 **Engagement Model**
StormWeaver Studios operates on a research-first, engineering-driven workflow.

- **Scope clearly. Build precisely. Iterate intelligently.**  
- All engagements prioritize performance, determinism, and technical depth.  
- For custom work or collaborations, reach out with a clear problem statement or research direction.

*(Personal note: coffee is always welcome.)*
