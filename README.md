Prayas Bharadwaj
Code-Slinging, Pixel-Pushing Chaos Machine

About Me
I’m Prayas Bharadwaj, a [insert your role, e.g., software dev, creative ninja] who’s basically a one-man army of code, design, and sheer audacity. I juggle languages like Java and Python while churning out 3D renders and app UIs so sexy they’d make a GPU blush. My life’s a high-stakes game of “Will it compile or will it explode?”—and I always win.

Core Features
Polyglot Programmer: I speak Java, C++, C, Python, C#, Kotlin, and Dart fluently—your compiler’s basically my bitch.
Library Lord: Wielding PyTorch for ML magic and Flutter for apps so smooth they’ll make you question your life choices.
Software Sorcerer: I bend Blender, Unreal, Substance, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Resolve to my will—call me the Da Vinci of digital disasters.
Setup Instructions
Wanna tap into this greatness? Here’s the deal:

Hit me up on [your contact, e.g., X, smoke signals].
Throw me a project wilder than a Blender crash on render day.
Watch me crank out brilliance faster than you can say “segmentation fault.”
Contributions
Got a crazy idea? Pitch it my way—but if it’s duller than a C++ manual, I’ll yeet it into orbit. Bring your A-game, and I might just bless it with some Prayas pizzazz.

License
I’m licensed under “Catch Me If You Can, Suckers.” Terms include coffee tributes and eternal bragging rights.

Contact
Crafted and maintained by the unstoppable Prayas Bharadwaj. Stalk me on [GitHub, X, etc.]—or don’t, I’ll be too busy rendering your mom’s Unreal Engine fanfic anyway.
