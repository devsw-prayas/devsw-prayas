# Prayas Bharadwaj
*Code-Slinging, 3D-Rendering, Pixel-Pushing Maniac*

## About Me
I’m Prayas Bharadwaj, a [self-proclaimed] software sorcerer and creative chaos agent who juggles more languages than a UN translator on a caffeine bender. I’m fluent in Java, C++, C, Python, C#, Kotlin, and Dart—because why settle for one when you can flex seven? I bend PyTorch and Flutter to my will, and when I’m not coding, I’m sculpting digital dreams in Blender, Unreal, Substance, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Resolve. Basically, I’m the human equivalent of a Swiss Army knife, but sexier and with better render times.

## Core Features
### Polyglot Programmer: 
I speak Java, C++, C, Python, C#, Kotlin, and Dart so fluently, I could sweet-talk your compiler into a date.
### Library Lord:
I wield PyTorch like a flamethrower and Flutter like a magic wand—AI and apps bow before me.
### Creative Beast: 
Blender? Unreal? Substance? I’m out here 3D-modeling your mom’s new kitchen while editing her vacation vids in Resolve. Photoshop and Illustrator just cry “yes, daddy” when I log in.
## Setup Instructions
Wanna activate this one-man tech army? Here’s the drill:

*Hit me up on LinkedIn or pray I don’t ghost you.*
*Throw me a project so wild it’d make a GPU sweat.*
*Watch me crank out code, graphics, and renders faster than you can say “where’s the documentation?”*
## Contributions
*Got a gig that needs a code ninja who can also 3D-print your dreams? Slide into my inbox with something that doesn’t make me yawn. I don’t do “basic”—bring me the good shit.*

## License
I’m licensed under “Prayas Ain’t Cheap, Bro.” Want my skills? Bring coffee, cash, or a really good sob story. Terms negotiable over a render queue.
